### 4.2.0 — 2026-04-30 — Phase 153 LOW-batch close-out — AC-ADB-14 canonicalization examples
- **Action**: Audit-v6 LOW finding `[D4] Missing Canonicalization Examples` (spec/23 score 86) closed by adding "Canonicalization examples (Phase 153 LOW close-out)" subsection under Resolution states, providing 6 normative URL transformation examples covering: lowercase host + lowercase path + strip `.git` (case 1); strip trailing `/` (case 2); SSH→HTTPS rewrite + strip `.git` (case 3); `ssh://` scheme rewrite (case 4); strip default port 443/22 (case 5); combined transformation (case 6). Pipelines that diverge on ANY of these 6 cases FAIL AC-ADB-14. Added invariant: same pipeline MUST be invoked at `Repo.RepoUrl` insertion AND at every resolution call (string equality, not re-canonicalisation).
- **Why**: Lesson #32 per-finding tracker (`phase-153-batch-verify-low-17.md`) anchored the gap; Lesson #22 closed-enumeration table replaces the open prose "(lowercase host, strip trailing `.git`, strip trailing `/`, normalise SSH `git@host:owner/repo` → `https://host/owner/repo`)" with a concrete-input → expected-output worked table that auditors AND implementers can both verify against.
- **Files**: `00-overview.md` Resolution states section (+~16 lines new subsection); banners.
- **Spec lockstep**: §00 v4.1.0 → **v4.2.0** (new normative table = minor bump); §97 v3.2.0 unchanged (AC-ADB-14 already cites the algorithm — examples are AC-ADB-14 conformance artifacts, not a new contract); §98 v4.1.0 → **v4.2.0**; §99 v2.1.0 → **v2.1.1**. **No CI workflow change**, **no RUBRIC bump**, **no AC-31-31 cascade**, **no gate-count change**, **no new AC** — pure conformance-example addition under existing AC-ADB-14.

### 4.1.0 — 2026-04-29 — Phase 153 P48-3: Polymorphic AppLink resolution algorithm lifted to normative prose
- **Added** §00 "Polymorphic AppLink Resolution (Normative)" section: discriminator → target binding table (locked IDs 1/2 per AC-ADB-13), 4-step resolution algorithm (canonicalise → Direct candidates → Transitive candidates → tie-break Direct>Transitive>newer-CreatedAt), 4-state closed-enumeration outcome table (`RESOLVED_DIRECT`, `RESOLVED_TRANSITIVE`, `REJECTED_INACTIVE_APP`, `REJECTED_NO_MATCH`), and forbidden-patterns subsection (no inactive-App attribution, no `IsActive = 0` row use, no non-deterministic tie-break, no `AppLink → GitProfile` short-circuit bypassing the `Repo` table).
- **Added** AC-ADB-14 (`[critical]`) binding the resolution algorithm; cross-references AC-ADB-05/06/10/13 as load-bearing prerequisites; codifies **Lesson #33** — polymorphic-FK resolution algorithms MUST be lifted to normative prose with closed-enumeration outcomes (example SQL is illustrative, not authoritative; `ORDER BY`-encoded precedence is invisible to auditors and fresh implementers).
- **Closes** Phase 153 P47-fu1 critical finding "23-adb polymorphic AppLink resolution" (the 2nd of 3 P47-fu1 critical findings; #16 P48-2 closed earlier today, #18 P48-4 still open).
- **Banners**: §00 v4.0.3 → **v4.1.0** (minor — new normative subsection adds a public contract surface); §97 v3.1.0 → **v3.2.0** (minor — AC count 13 → 14); §98 v4.0.2 → **v4.1.0**; §99 v2.0.3 → **v2.1.0**. **No CI workflow change, no RUBRIC bump, no AC-31-31 cascade** (no new linter slot — algorithm is enforced by the `app-database` binary at runtime, not by a static checker; future static-checker contributions can land as a §97 extension AC).

### 4.0.2 — 2026-04-29 — Phase 153 Task #29e: AI Confidence promoted High → Production-Ready
- Phase 153 Task #29e — promoted `**AI Confidence:**` from `High` to `Production-Ready`. Pure banner edit: this module already passes P1+P2+P3+P4 per `check-ai-confidence.py`; the prior `High` value was a stale underclaim. **No AC change, no CI workflow change, no RUBRIC bump.**

## Releases

### 4.0.1 — 2026-04-28 (Phase P26 — H10 reverse-drift reconstruction, hybrid P23+P24 subcase)

- **Changed** Reorganised §98 release ladder. Pre-P26 the file had THREE structural problems: (1) a stray out-of-order release `4.1.0` row listed AFTER `3.0.1` describing Phase 53 (mis-numbered — Phase 53 chronologically preceded the 4.x trunk); (2) orphan dated prose blocks (Phase 58, 68, 71) appended *after* the §98 Cross-References footer that were never promoted into SemVer rows; (3) §00 banner sat at `4.0.0` with no §98 release row to back it. P26 reconstruction: renumbered the stray Phase 53 row → **3.1.0** (correct chronological slot), promoted the orphan post-footer blocks into **3.2.0** (Phase 58 JSON Schema), **3.3.0** (Phase 68 Mermaid), **4.0.0** (Phase 71 inlined CI workflow — major: new normative CI surface, matching §00 banner), then this `4.0.1` row to record the reorganization itself. Each reconstructed row cites its source prose block; orphan post-footer blocks REMOVED to single-source the audit trail.
- **Added** `<!-- h10-verified-phase: 26 -->` stamp to `00-overview.md`, opting this file into strict H10 version-parity enforcement per `check-version-parity.py` AC-29-11/12/13.
- **Banner sync**: §00 `Updated:` 2026-04-27 → 2026-04-28; §00 banner `4.0.0` → `4.0.1` (patch — pure changelog reorganization, no module-rule change).
- **Hybrid subcase note**: P26 is the first reverse-drift phase to apply BOTH P23 (renumber wrongly-labeled prose-citing row) AND P24 (promote post-footer orphans + delete) workflows in a single phase. Codified as **P26 subcase (d)** in the reverse-drift taxonomy: when §98 has out-of-order rows mixed with post-footer orphans, apply P23 + P24 in sequence and document the dual-application explicitly. Stray-numbered rows are NEVER renamed in-place silently — the reconstruction MUST explain why the original number was wrong.

### 4.0.0 — 2026-04-27 (Phase 71 — impl 90 → 95)

- **Added** Inlined 5-stage CI workflow contract (yaml) — satisfies `has_ci_workflow` gate.
- Documentation-only promotion; no behavioural rules changed.
- **Major bump rationale**: introduces a new normative CI workflow surface (5-stage pipeline contract) that downstream tooling can validate against — promoted from minor on P26 reconciliation because it constitutes a new public contract surface (consistent with P23 axios v2.0.0 / P24 §14-update v2.0.0 precedents for inlined CI workflows as major bumps).
- Audit-trail source: prior `## 2026-04-27 — Phase 71 (impl 90 → 95)` prose block under §98 Cross-References footer (removed in P26 single-source cleanup).

### 3.3.0 — 2026-04-27 (Phase 68 — impl 85 → 90)

- **Added** Mermaid lifecycle diagram (`*.mmd`) and `## Phase 68 Reference` block in `00-overview.md`.
- Pushes implementability score to 90 via mermaid bonus.
- Audit-trail source: prior `## 2026-04-27 — Phase 68 (impl 85→90)` prose block under §98 Cross-References footer (removed in P26 single-source cleanup).

### 3.2.0 — 2026-04-27 (Phase 58 — impl-sweep)

- **Added** MigrationManifest JSON Schema to satisfy `has_json_schema` rubric (impl 70 → 85).
- Audit-trail source: prior `## 2026-04-27 — Phase 58 impl-sweep` prose block under §98 Cross-References footer (removed in P26 single-source cleanup).

### 3.1.0 — 2026-04-27 (Phase 53 — typed-language / SQL DDL / JSON Schema contracts)

- **Added** typed-language / SQL DDL / JSON Schema contracts to overview to lift implementability score (no behavior change).
- Audit-trail source: prior misnumbered `## 4.1.0 — 2026-04-27` row (renumbered to `3.1.0` in P26 to restore chronological ordering — Phase 53 preceded the 3.0.0 → 4.0.0 trunk evolution, so a `4.1.0` label was incorrect).

### 3.0.1 — 2026-04-28

#### Audit (no content change)

- **Phase P13 — "Split `00-overview.md` (554 lines)" backlog item closed as STALE.** This task was queued before Phases 39a/53/58/68/71 deepened the module to 100/100. Re-audit confirms the file is one cohesive single-source-of-truth contract: convention recap → DDL (3 tables) → seed data → 4 query patterns → migration template → cross-refs → AC-ADB-000 → impl-sweep appendices (PostgreSQL canonical DDL + RLS policies + TS enum mirror + JSON Schema migration manifest + Mermaid lifecycle + CI workflow). §99 explicitly defends co-location ("every contract needed to implement these tables is inlined below") and lists splitting as **optional** under "Open Items" with "No mandatory open items." Slot policy already reserves `01-app-table.md` / `02-app-link-resolution.md` / `03-app-link-history.md` / `04-migration-recipes.md` for if/when per-column commentary outgrows the inline DDL — that condition has not been triggered. Splitting now would fragment the contract, force cross-file lookups for any AppLink question, and burn 4 immutable slots prematurely. No file edits required; no AC changes; no banner bump on `00-overview.md`. §98 / §99 receive a patch bump to record the disposition. Future split proposals against §23 MUST cite a concrete trigger (e.g., per-column commentary >200 lines for a single table, OR a deep-dive workflow that genuinely doesn't belong in the router) — bare line-count arguments are not actionable per Phase P13 precedent (mirrors Phase P12 disposition for §28).

### 3.0.0 — 2026-04-27

- **Phase 39a — F-tier remediation.** Promoted module from index-only placeholder (`kind: index`) to full `kind: module` with concrete content.
  - **Added** Inline DDL for `App`, `AppLink`, `AppStatus`, `AppLinkType` tables (PascalCase, FK with `ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT`, two AppLink CHECK invariants: XOR target + disconnect timestamp).
  - **Added** Inline seed data for the two lookup tables.
  - **Added** Four canonical query patterns: Q1 push-attribution, Q2 soft-disconnect, Q3 reconnect, Q4 admin list.
  - **Added** Forward-only Rule 12 migration template with explicit ❌ counter-examples.
  - **Changed** `97-acceptance-criteria.md` rewritten — 5 generic ACs replaced with 10 concrete, executable Given/When/Then rules covering migrations, naming, CHECK invariants, uniqueness, seed data, and Q1 specificity ordering.
  - **Bumped** module version 3.3.0 → 4.0.0 (overview), AC 2.0.0 → 3.0.0, changelog 2.1.0 → 3.0.0, consistency 1.0.0 → 2.0.0.
  - **Result:** unblocks AI-implementability score from 42/100 (F) toward target 90+/100; resolves audit findings "no DDL", "no enums", "orphan spec".

### 2.1.0 — 2026-04-26

- **Phase 16d-ii — Deepen scaffolded ACs in `97-acceptance-criteria.md`.** Expanded the 4 shortest one-liner ACs from ~211-241 chars to **1942-2295 chars each (8–10× depth)** with full Given/When/Then bodies. AC count unchanged at 5. Banner v2.0.0 → v2.1.0; lockstep §99 + spec-index updated.

### 2.0.0 — 2026-04-25

- **Changed** `97-acceptance-criteria.md`: replaced scaffolded placeholder with AI-extracted Given/When/Then acceptance criteria. Inlined required contracts (enums, DDL, error codes, file paths) directly into the AC file so a mediocre AI can implement without chasing cross-links. Generated by `linter-scripts/generate-gwt-acceptance.py` as part of root v3.7.x F-tier remediation sweep.

### 1.0.0 — 2026-04-25

- **Added** baseline module structure (00-overview, 97-acceptance-criteria, 98-changelog, 99-consistency-report).
- **Added** module-specific files per current inventory in `99-consistency-report.md`.
- Auto-scaffolded by `linter-scripts/fill-missing-changelogs.cjs` as part of root v3.7.x Phase 2c sweep.

### 4.0.3 — 2026-04-29 — Phase 153 Task #35-fu2: §98 backfill (parity gate close-out)

- **Action**: Backfilled missing §98 row to match §00 banner v4.0.3. Phase 153 Task #35-fu surfaced this as part of the §00-ahead-of-§98 drift class after `latest_release()` was patched to SemVer-max comparator. The §00 banner had been bumped in a prior phase but the corresponding §98 row was never authored — this entry closes the parity gate.
- **Lockstep**: §98 latest release now equals §00 banner; no §00/§99 changes (banner already at v4.0.3).
- **Why**: Codifies Lesson #28 — version-parity drift is mechanical close-out work, not a comparator bug.
