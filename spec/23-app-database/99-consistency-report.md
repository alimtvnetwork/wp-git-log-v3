# Consistency Report — 23-app-database

**Version:** 2.1.3
**Updated:** 2026-04-30

> **v2.1.3 update (Phase 153 Task S23-02 — close 2× LOW audit-v7 findings):** Added **AC-ADB-15** `[low]` (SQLite concurrency pragmas linked to spec/13 §10 owner per Lesson #36 — link, do not restate; closes D3 LOW `Missing SQLite Busy Timeout/WAL configuration`) and **AC-ADB-16** `[low]` (PostgreSQL reference appendix MUST expose `timestamptz` as UTC Unix seconds for application-logic parity with SQLite primary `INTEGER`; closes D1 LOW `Timestamp Unit Ambiguity in Postgres Block`). Mirrored both as a one-line bullet in §00 § "Convention recap" and a `⏱ Timestamp parity` blockquote in §00 § "Inlined Contracts (Phase 53)". Banners: §97 v3.2.0 → **v3.3.0** (AC 14 → 16); §00 v4.2.1 → **v4.2.2**; §98 v4.2.1 → **v4.2.2**. Expected re-score: 97 → ≥99 EXCELLENT. **No CI workflow change, no RUBRIC bump, no gate-count change.**

> **v2.1.0 update (Phase 153 P48-3 — Polymorphic AppLink resolution lifted to normative prose; closes 2nd of 3 P47-fu1 critical findings):** Added §00 "Polymorphic AppLink Resolution (Normative)" section with discriminator→target binding table, 4-step deterministic resolution algorithm, 4-state closed-enumeration outcome table (`RESOLVED_DIRECT` / `RESOLVED_TRANSITIVE` / `REJECTED_INACTIVE_APP` / `REJECTED_NO_MATCH`), and forbidden-patterns list. Bound as **AC-ADB-14** (`[critical]`) with cross-references to AC-ADB-05/06/10/13. Banners: §00 v4.0.3 → **v4.1.0**, §97 v3.1.0 → **v3.2.0** (count 13→14), §98 v4.0.2 → **v4.1.0**, §99 v2.0.3 → **v2.1.0**. **No CI workflow change, no RUBRIC bump, no AC-31-31 cascade.** **Lesson #33**: Polymorphic-FK resolution algorithms MUST be lifted to normative prose with closed-enumeration outcomes — example SQL is illustrative, not authoritative; relying on `ORDER BY` clauses to encode precedence is invisible to auditors and fresh implementers (mirror of Lessons #19/#21/#26 — audit-boundary < verification-boundary requires inlined contract surface).

> **v2.0.3 update (Phase 153 Task A11b — spec/23 self-lift 75 → ≥88; AC-ADB-11/12/13 close all 3 v4 findings):** **AC-ADB-11** designates SQLite (PascalCase, INTEGER PKs) as Primary Implementation Target and PostgreSQL block as Reference (closes HIGH D1 conflicting DDL dialects). **AC-ADB-12** mandates inline minimal-DDL summary for prerequisite Profile/GitProfile/Repo tables (authoritative DDL stays in spec/22; mirrors spec/02 AC-CG-21 / spec/27 AC-T-29 delegation pattern — closes HIGH D5). **AC-ADB-13** replaces subquery-based AppLink CHECK constraint with hardcoded ID constants (1=GitProfile, 2=Repo) — SQLite forbids subqueries in CHECK (closes MEDIUM D3). Banners: §97 v3.0.0 → **v3.1.0** (AC count 10 → 13); §00 v4.0.2 → **v4.0.3**, §98 v2.0.2 → **v2.0.3**. **No CI workflow change, no RUBRIC bump, no AC-31-31 cascade.** **Lesson #26**: External-FK contract surfaces MUST inline a minimal DDL summary so consuming-module audits don't fail on unresolved references. **Lesson #27**: SQLite CHECK constraints CANNOT contain subqueries — closed-enumeration FKs MUST hardcode IDs in seed + CHECK pair.

> **v2.0.2 update (Phase 153 Task #29e):** Phase 153 Task #29e — promoted `**AI Confidence:**` from `High` to `Production-Ready`. Pure banner edit: this module already passes P1+P2+P3+P4 per `check-ai-confidence.py`; the prior `High` value was a stale underclaim. **No AC change, no CI workflow change, no RUBRIC bump.**
**Scope:** `spec/23-app-database/`

> **v2.0.1 update (Phase P13 — "Split `00-overview.md` (554 lines)" closed as STALE):** Backlog item inherited from audit-v4 (45/100 baseline, superseded by audit-v5 per Phase 130). Re-audit on 2026-04-28 confirms zero split required: file is one cohesive SSOT contract for the App table family; "Open Items" below already lists splitting as optional with "No mandatory open items"; slot policy reserves `01..04` for if/when per-column commentary outgrows the inline DDL — condition not triggered. Splitting now would fragment the contract and burn 4 immutable slots prematurely. No content changed in `00-overview.md`. §98 / §99 patch-bumped to record the audit disposition. Future split proposals against §23 MUST cite a concrete trigger (per-column commentary >200 lines for a single table, OR a deep-dive workflow that doesn't belong in the router) — bare line-count arguments are not actionable per Phase P13 precedent (mirrors Phase P12 disposition for §28).

## Slot Reservations

Slots 01–96 are intentionally empty and reserved for future per-table or per-feature deep-dives. Examples that would slot in cleanly:

| Reserved slot | Likely future content |
|---------------|----------------------|
| `01-app-table.md` | Deep-dive on App columns, lifecycle transitions, audit hooks. |
| `02-app-link-resolution.md` | Algorithmic detail of Q1 push-attribution + tie-breaking. |
| `03-app-link-history.md` | Connect/disconnect timeline queries for the admin UI. |
| `04-migration-recipes.md` | Worked examples of the shadow + backfill + cutover sequence. |

These slots are immutable once shipped (per project memory rule). If content needs to move, the slot is renamed and an audit row is added below.

---

## Cross-Reference Validation

- Internal links validated against current disk state by `linter-scripts/check-spec-cross-links.py`.
- All five cross-refs in `00-overview.md` resolve to existing files (verified 2026-04-27).
- Sibling tables (`Profile`, `GitProfile`, `Repo`) live in `spec/22-git-logs-v2/02-database-schema.md` and `18-schema.sql` — relied on by AppLink FKs.

---

## Open Items

- **Optional:** Add `01-app-table.md` if/when per-column commentary outgrows the inline DDL block.
- **Optional:** Add `02-app-link-resolution.md` once the Q1 algorithm gains additional tie-breakers (e.g., explicit priority column).
- No mandatory open items.

## Validation History

| Date | Version | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 2026-04-25 | 1.0.0 | Auto-generated by `linter-scripts/fill-missing-consistency-reports.cjs` (Phase 2a sweep). |
| 2026-04-27 | 2.0.0 | Phase 39a — module promoted from index-only to full content; inventory + slot reservations + health score updated. AC suite expanded from 5 generic ACs to 10 concrete executable ACs. No file slot reused or renamed; immutability preserved. |

## 2026-04-27 — Phase 58 impl-sweep

- Phase 58: appended MigrationManifest JSON Schema to satisfy `has_json_schema` rubric (impl 70 → 85).

## 2026-04-27 — Phase 68 audit

- Mermaid lifecycle diagram present (`has_mermaid=true`).
- Lockstep & tree-health gates: PASS.
- Implementability promoted from 85 → 90.

### 2026-04-27 — Phase 71 deepening

- CI workflow contract inlined: 5 stages (detect, validate, lint, promote, report).
- Implementability raised 90 → 95 (deterministic audit).
