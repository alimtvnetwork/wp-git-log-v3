## Drift Acknowledgment

**Date:** 2026-04-26  
**Severity:** Low — doc-hygiene drift.

Inventory double-listing + missing `01-frontend-backend-sync.md` — sub-file is forward-looking; current listing is accurate to delivery roadmap.

Tracked under Phase 27d. See `.lovable/memory/index.md`.

### CI Workflow — Phase 70 Reference

The following workflow snippets are normative for this module. Each fenced
`yaml` block represents a stage that MUST be present in the consuming
repository's CI pipeline.

on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  detect:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: linter-scripts/detect-changed-modules.sh
```

```yaml
name: spec-gate-stage-2-validate
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [detect]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: linter-scripts/validate-contracts.py
```

```yaml
