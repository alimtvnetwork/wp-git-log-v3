# Acceptance Criteria — Split DB Architecture — Issues Index

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Updated:** 2026-04-25  
**Scope:** `spec/05-split-db-architecture/03-issues/`

---

## Purpose

This document defines testable acceptance criteria for the **Split DB Architecture — Issues Index** module. Every criterion is verifiable from the module's content alone — an AI implementer or human reviewer can check pass/fail without external context.

---

## Criteria

### AC-01: Module entry point exists and is non-trivial
- **Given** the module folder `spec/05-split-db-architecture/03-issues/`
- **When** `00-overview.md` is opened
- **Then** it contains an H1 title, a `**Version:**` banner, an `**Updated:**` date, and at least one body section.
- **Source:** `00-overview.md`

### AC-02: All sibling files referenced from the overview are present on disk
- **Given** the link inventory in `00-overview.md`
- **When** each relative `.md` link is resolved
- **Then** the target file exists in this module folder.
- **Source:** `00-overview.md` cross-references; verified by `linter-scripts/check-spec-cross-links.py`.

### AC-03: Naming convention compliance
- **Given** every file in this module
- **When** filenames are inspected
- **Then** all match `^[0-9]{2}-[a-z0-9-]+\.md$` (or are recognized special files like `README.md`).
- **Source:** `../../01-spec-authoring-guide/02-naming-conventions.md`.

### AC-04: Consistency report present and current
- **Given** the module folder
- **When** `99-consistency-report.md` is opened
- **Then** it lists every `.md` file in this folder under "File Inventory" with status ✅.
- **Source:** `99-consistency-report.md`.

### AC-05: Module passes the tree-health gate
- **Given** the entire `spec/` tree
- **When** `node linter-scripts/check-tree-health.cjs --min=80` is run
- **Then** this module contributes `required=2/2` (overview + consistency report present) and the overall score is ≥ 80.
- **Source:** `linter-scripts/check-tree-health.cjs`.

---

### AC-06: Module overview is non-trivial and version-banner-stamped
- **Given** the module file `spec/05-split-db-architecture/03-issues/00-overview.md`
- **When** the file is read by `linter-scripts/audit-spec-vs-code-v2.py`
- **Then** the body MUST contain at least one fenced contract block (sql/json/yaml/ts/typed-language) AND a `**Version:**` banner near the top, otherwise the deterministic audit emits a `missing-contract` finding.
- **Source:** `linter-scripts/audit-spec-vs-code-v2.py` (rubric v2.13).

### AC-07: Cross-spec links resolve against the on-disk tree
- **Given** the inventory of `[label](path.md)` links in this module's `00-overview.md`
- **When** `python3 linter-scripts/check-spec-cross-links.py` is run
- **Then** zero links MUST be reported as broken; any drift MUST be fixed before merge per `.github/workflows/spec-health.yml` Phase 81 strict gate.
- **Source:** `linter-scripts/check-spec-cross-links.py`.

### AC-08: Lockstep between §98 changelog and §99 consistency report
- **Given** the most recent date stamp in `98-changelog.md`
- **When** `node linter-scripts/check-lockstep.cjs --strict` is run
- **Then** that date MUST also appear as a section header in `99-consistency-report.md`; the strict gate (Phase 81) blocks merge on any mismatch.
- **Source:** `linter-scripts/check-lockstep.cjs`.

## Module-Specific Files

The following files in this module also constitute acceptance surface — each must remain valid markdown with a top-level H1 and version banner:

- `00-overview.md`

---

## Validation

Run the full pipeline:

```bash
bash linter-scripts/run.sh
```

This executes: validator → self-heal → regen index → tree-health gate. All steps must exit 0 for this module's acceptance to hold.
