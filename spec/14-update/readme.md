# 08 — Generic Self-Update Specification

## Purpose

This folder defines a **generic, reusable blueprint** for implementing
self-update functionality in CLI tools. It covers the full lifecycle:
detecting where the binary is installed, building a new version,
deploying it without file-lock errors, and cleaning up afterward.

Any AI or engineer reading these documents should be able to implement
a complete self-update system from scratch without ambiguity.

See the Mermaid diagram: [`images/self-update-flow.mmd`](images/self-update-flow.mmd)

```
<binary> update
    |
    +-- Resolve deploy target (running location > PATH > config)
    +-- Source repo available?
    |   +-- YES: Pull, build, deploy (rename-first)
    |   +-- NO:  Download pre-built binary from releases
    |
    +-- Deploy to running executable's directory
    |   +-- Rename existing binary to .old
    |   +-- Copy new binary
    |   +-- Copy data/ folder alongside binary
    |
    +-- Register directory in PATH (if first-time)
    +-- Reload terminal environment
    +-- Verify: <binary> version == expected
    +-- Cleanup temporary files
```

## Core Principles

1. **Deploy to running location** — The binary is always replaced
   in-place at the directory it is currently running from.
2. **Data co-location** — The `data/` folder lives alongside the
   binary at its physical location. Moving the binary moves data too.
3. **PATH auto-registration** — On first-time install, the deploy
   directory is added to PATH and the terminal is reloaded.
4. **Rename-first** — On Windows, rename the locked binary before
   replacing it. Never rely on overwrite retries alone.

## Placeholders

| Placeholder | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `<binary>` | Your CLI binary name (e.g., `mytool`) |
| `<binary>.exe` | Windows binary with extension |
| `<deploy-dir>` | The directory where the binary is installed |
| `<repo-root>` | The root of the source repository |
