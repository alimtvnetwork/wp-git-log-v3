## Overview

App-specific issue analysis, root cause analysis, bug documentation, and solution guidance at the root spec level. This folder tracks problems encountered during application development, their diagnosis, and their resolution.

---

## Placement Rule

Any content that analyzes bugs, failures, root causes, or fixes for application-level work belongs here. General coding principle violations or cross-cutting concerns belong in the core fundamentals range (`01–20`).
