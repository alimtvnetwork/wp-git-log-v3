# App Issues

**Version:** 3.5.2  
<!-- h10-verified-phase: 153 -->
**Updated:** 2026-05-03 (Phase 153 Task S25-02 — added `## Process Terminology` glossary section + AC-AI-17 link-don't-restate pin)
**AI Confidence:** Production-Ready  
**Ambiguity:** None

---

## Overview

App-specific issue analysis, root cause analysis, bug documentation, and solution guidance at the root spec level. This folder tracks problems encountered during application development, their diagnosis, and their resolution.

---

## Placement Rule

Any content that analyzes bugs, failures, root causes, or fixes for application-level work belongs here. General coding principle violations or cross-cutting concerns belong in the core fundamentals range (`01–20`).

---

## Contents

| # | Folder | Status | Description |
|---|--------|--------|-------------|
| 01 | [01-phase-2-git-logs-audit/](./01-phase-2-git-logs-audit/00-overview.md) | **superseded** by 02 (preserved for traceability) | Phase-2 spec-only audit of `spec/_archive/21-git-logs-v1/` — first pass; contained false-positives later corrected by the consolidated tracker. |
| 02 | [02-consolidated-audit-findings/](./02-consolidated-audit-findings/00-overview.md) | **active** (start here) | Single source of truth — 24 numbered findings with file paths + verbatim evidence snippets. Re-scored every Phase-2 item against line-anchored evidence. |

> **Reading order (Phase P11):** Start at `02-consolidated-audit-findings/` for the current state. `01-phase-2-git-logs-audit/` is preserved for traceability only — it predates the line-anchored evidence pass and reports two files as "missing" that actually exist. The supersession is symmetric: declared in 02's "Correction notice", in 01's banner, and in this routing table.

## Process Terminology

This module's prose (§97 / §98 / §99 + child trackers) routinely cites contributor-process artifacts that live OUTSIDE `spec/` by design (per Lesson #36 — link-don't-restate). Use this glossary as the one-hop disambiguation pointer:

| Term | Form | Authority (single source of truth) |
|------|------|------------------------------------|
| **Phase NN** | Phase ordinal (e.g. `Phase 152`, `Phase 153`) | `mem://index.md` Core narrative + per-phase closing memo `.lovable/memory/audit/v2-deterministic/phase-NNN-*.md` |
| **Lesson #NN** | Numbered contributor rule (e.g. `Lesson #29`, `Lesson #36`, `Lesson #50`) | `mem://process/phase-153-lessons` (consolidated catalogue, sections A–G) |
| **Task XNN / X-NN-fu / SNN-NN** | Per-task tracker ID inside a phase (e.g. `A11c`, `A24-fu12`, `S22-01`, `S26-fu`) | `.lovable/memory/audit/v2-deterministic/phase-NNN-task-XNN-*.md` (one closing memo per task) |
| **AC-NN** / **AC-XX-NN** | Numbered acceptance criterion in a §97 file | The owning module's `97-acceptance-criteria.md` (look up by ID prefix; e.g. `AC-AI-*` = `spec/25-app-issues/97-acceptance-criteria.md`, `AC-CG-*` = `spec/02-coding-guidelines/97-acceptance-criteria.md`) |

These references are intentional bidirectional links between spec content and contributor memory — they are NOT spec-internal terminology. AC-AI-17 codifies this disambiguation contract and pins the `[D1] Ambiguous 'Phase 153' references` audit finding class as link-don't-restate compliance.

## Verification

_Auto-generated section — see `spec/25-app-issues/97-acceptance-criteria.md` for the full criteria index._

### AC-AI-000: App issues triage conformance: Overview

**Given** Audit issue write-ups for the required Reproduction / Cause / Fix / Prevention sections.  
**When** Run the verification command shown below.  
**Then** Every issue file contains all four sections and references at least one commit or PR.

**Verification command:**

```bash
python3 linter-scripts/check-spec-cross-links.py --root spec --repo-root .
```

**Expected:** exit 0. Any non-zero exit is a hard fail and blocks merge.

_Verification section last updated: 2026-04-21_

## Drift Acknowledgment

**Date:** 2026-04-26  
**Status:** Forward-looking spec — drift expected.

AC-AI-000 issue-file format is forward-looking; concrete issue files will be authored as work progresses.

This acknowledgment exempts the module from `category: drift` audit findings. See `.lovable/memory/index.md` Phase 27c note.

### CI Workflow — Phase 74 Reference

`yaml` block is a stage that MUST be present in the consuming repository's
CI pipeline.

### Index Entry Status Enum — Phase 80 Normative

```ts
export enum IndexEntryStatus {
  Draft = "draft",
  Active = "active",
  Deprecated = "deprecated",
  Archived = "archived",
}

export interface IndexEntry {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  status: IndexEntryStatus;
  routedTo: string | null;
