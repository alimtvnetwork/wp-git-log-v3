---

## Standalone Compliance

- [x] All files are self-contained — no "Full spec: [link]" back-references
- [x] Each file contains enough detail for AI implementation without source specs
- [x] Code examples included where applicable
- [x] Schema definitions included where applicable

---

## Database Convention Compliance

- [x] All table names are **singular** PascalCase (`User`, `Transaction`, `Project`)
- [x] All PKs follow `{TableName}Id` pattern with INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT
- [x] All FKs use exact PK name from referenced table
- [x] All booleans use `Is`/`Has` prefix, positive only, NOT NULL DEFAULT
- [x] Singular convention enforced across consolidated and source specs

---

## Cross-Reference Validation

- [x] `03-error-management.md` source path updated to `spec/03-error-manage/`
- [x] `04-enum-standards.md` links updated — coding guidelines subfolders at `02-coding-guidelines/` root
- [x] `02-coding-guidelines.md` source path updated — `03-coding-guidelines-spec/` folder flattened
- [x] All `13-self-update-app-update` references corrected to `14-update`
- [x] Full dashboard scan: **1,510 links checked, 0 broken — 100/100 (A+)**
