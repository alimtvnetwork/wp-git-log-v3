# Consistency Report: PHP Standards

**Version:** 4.0.0
**Generated:** 2026-04-27
**Health Score:** 100/100 (A+)

> **v4.0.0 update (Phase 16k):** §97 fully rewritten from 7 table-row criteria (AC-01..AC-07) to **20 module-specific Given/When/Then ACs** (AC-PHP-01..AC-PHP-20). New ACs codify PHP-specific rules layered on cross-language parent: explicit AC-CL-* inheritance, PHP 8.1+ + `declare(strict_types=1)` mandatory, string-backed enums with PascalCase cases+values, mandatory `isEqual()`, `ResultHelper` exhaustive return contract, `ResponseKeyType::Foo->value` keys, role-based casing, boolean prefix discipline, `use`-imported globals, `safeExecute` REST wrap + `wp_die()` FORBIDDEN, blank-line discipline, `readonly` DTOs, full type declarations, `BaseException` hierarchy, `phpstan --level=8` + `psalm` zero-issue gate, PSR-4 file-per-class, PHPUnit 10+ `#[Test]` attribute, composer pinning, PSR-3 logging with no `error_log`/`var_dump`, self-application doctest. Legacy AC-01..AC-07 preserved as AC-PHP-LEGACY-* at end of §97. Module-level tree-health: 100/100 (A+).

## Naming Convention Compliance

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Lowercase kebab-case | ✅ All files compliant |
| Numeric prefixes | ✅ All files prefixed |
| Sequential numbering | ℹ️ Gaps at 04, 06 (intentional — files removed during consolidation) |

---

## Notes

- Files `04-php-go-consistency-audit.md` and `06-response-key-type-inventory.md` were removed as duplicates (superseded by `09` and `10`). Gaps preserved to avoid renumbering existing cross-references.

---

## Summary

- **Errors:** 0
- **Warnings:** 0
- **Observations:** 1 (numbering gaps at 04, 06 — intentional, preserves cross-references)
- **Health Score:** 100/100 (A+)

## Validation History

| Date | Version | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 2026-03-31 | 3.2.0 | Reclassified numbering gaps from warning to observation — intentional gaps don't reduce health score |
| 2026-03-31 | 3.0.0 | Updated — removed deleted files, added 08-10, documented numbering gaps |
| 2026-03-22 | 2.0.0 | Regenerated — inventory synchronized with disk contents |
